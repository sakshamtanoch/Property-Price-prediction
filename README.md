# Linear Regression Model to Predict Property Prices in Pune

## Introduction
This project is about building a linear regression model to predict the price of properties in Pune, India. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. However, the data was not good and needed extensive preprocessing in Excel before exploratory data analysis (EDA) could be performed using Google Colab. The purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of properties in Pune, based on their features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of properties in Pune with their respective features and prices. The dataset contains information about the area of the property, the number of bedrooms, the location, and the builder.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the relationship between the price and features of the properties. Price vs. Property builder and price vs. locations were analyzed to understand the relationship between these variables. The visualizations were created using the Plotly library for interactive visualizations.

## Machine Learning Model
Linear regression was used to build the machine learning model for this project. Scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy were the main libraries used to develop the model. The dataset was not split into test and training sets, as the project was small and simple.

The accuracy of the model was 81%. The model was able to predict property prices with reasonable accuracy based on the given features.

## Conclusion
This machine learning project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to predict property prices in Pune. By performing exploratory data analysis, preprocessing the data, and building a machine learning model, it is possible to accurately predict the price of properties in Pune. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the model can be improved by using a larger dataset and by including more features.
